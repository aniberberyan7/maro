    "text": "Armenian sweet sujukh is a traditional treat made from nuts threaded on a string and coated in a thickened grape must, creating a chewy, sweet snack. Typically, walnuts, hazelnuts, or almonds are used, which are carefully strung together and then dipped repeatedly in a mixture of grape juice and flour until a glossy, caramel-like coating forms. Once dried, it becomes a long, rope-like candy that is both nutritious and indulgent.",

Unlike the typical long, rope-like sujukh, the round variety is shaped into small, bite-sized balls, making it perfect for snacking or gifting.",
